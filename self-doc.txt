Core java  
  Checked exception and custome exception implementation
  Try with resouces-Autocloseable or closeable Inerface and supperesed exception  
  Test cases example
  Implementation of TreeMap and Priority Queue works 
  What is ThreadLocal segnificant.
  
Custome Checked Exception  
	All the Sub classes of java.lang.Exception except subclasses of RuntimeException are checked exception.

Custome UnChecked or Runtime Exception
	All the subclasses of RunTimeException or subclass of Error are RuntimeException

Implement Autoclosable for try with resouces

Give examples of Immutable classes provided by Java.
 Which design pattern is used when you delegate the exception handling responsibility to the caller.[Class Loader, Bootstrap, Extention, ext-folder -applcation file ]

Loading sequence of static and non static members of a class

java 8:     Stream API, Functional Interface,interface default/static and 			 private(java9), Lambda exp,Optional clss,
			New Date Time API
			
java 9 		Interface private method , Module system, Flow API ,RxJava,
			List.of(a, b,c),StackWalker,StreamApi(takeWhile,dropWhile,ofNullable)
			new methods in CompletableFuture API (delay, timeout)

java 11:   var type allowed in Lambda Parameters:(@NonNull var x) -> process(x),
			New String 	methods(repeat,isBlank,strip, lines)
			
java 12:   New String methods (indent, transform)
			if (obj instanceof String s) {
				int length = s.length();
			}
			Teeing Collector
			File::mismatch
			
java 14/16- 	1.Good way to handle null pointer exception , what exactly was null in given code
			2.public record User(int id, String password) { };
			3.Pattern Matching at language level for instanceof 
			if (obj instanceof String str) {
				int len = str.length();
				// ...
			}
			Static members in inner classes (part of Record type JEP)
			new Object() {
			static record MyData(String data) {};
			public static final int CONSTANT = 1;
			};
			
Java 17 : Sealed Classes and permit,FloatVector.fromArray,SPECIES

java 18 : Simple Web Server
			SimpleFileServer.createFileServer(new InetSocketAddress(9000), path, logLevel).start();
			Cmd Line: jwebserver -p 9000

java 19 : 	Project loom,Virtual Threads(and Structure concurrency) : 
			OS thread not blocked when java threads blocked,
			Virtual threads solve this by having multiple Java threads map to a single OS thread. As a result, OS threads can now be used efficiently to service Java threads that need to do work, and an application can support literally millions of simultaneous connections.
			
			structured concurrency API is for I/O-intensive tasks,where as ForkJoinPool is designed to handle compute-	intensive tasks
			
			Access Foreign Programming language in java - Java new Panama project
			(Foreign Function and Memory APIs)
			language level pattern matching 
				if (o instance record Point (x,y)) {}
			
			Map<String, Integer> map = HashMap.newHashMap(120);
